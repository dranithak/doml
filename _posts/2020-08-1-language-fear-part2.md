We moved our luggage into the new apartment and went out for grocery shopping.
Guess what? I  have never seen such a large variety of foods.
I actually felt that shopping might be difficult for me because I’m new to all of this.
So I asked my spouse to help me find them.
But he suggested that I ask the store manager instead.
Don’t know why, but I felt a little annoyed at his suggestion because I felt he was doubting my english speaking skills.
But I took it as a challenge to show my spouse what I’m capable of.
I took courage to take my first step and started walking towards the store manager.
Then I asked what I needed and he answered.
I was unable to understand.
I thought about whether I should ask him again or not.
I realized I was blocking the way for other people who were waiting at the billing counter,
so I stepped away from the store manager to clear the way.
I got freaked because I could barely comprehend his words.
I stood there startled.
The store manager understood my situation and helped me find the item I needed by coming along with me to the aisle.
After going through all this I saw my spouse with the same item at the billing counter.
In my mind I felt like he was judging me for my language skills.
The store manager saw me with my spouse and asked him if we got all the items we needed.
My spouse replied yes.
I felt belittled about this entire experience on my very first day in the USA.

The very next day I got a call from my spouse and he gave me shocking news.
His colleagues arranged a dinner party at the OLIVE GARDEN.
First I need to train myself to greet everyone.
Seriously preparing myself for this dinner felt daunting.
I just prayed to God and hoped everything goes well there.
Finally the time came and we reached the OLIVE GARDEN at 6PM.
An unknown fear started within me. Everyone had already reached there and started greeting me.
They were very friendly and polite.
I was relaxed because the conversation went smoothly.
We placed our orders and this was when my struggle began.
Food was still on the way to our table, there was plenty of time and everyone started asking questions.
I just stared at my spouse seeking help because I couldn’t understand what they were asking me.
He explained every question they asked and I answered them.
Then the food is being served.
The food was delicious, and we had done enough eating.
Then a thought came by, that my spouse’s colleagues might start asking me questions again.
So I whispered to him asking if we could leave early. We thanked everyone and left the party.
I felt bad for deciding to leave the party early just because I couldn’t handle that situation.
This how my initial days in the USA went by.

I started my education at a private english medium school at the age of 4 years.
I continued up to my bachelor's degree in India.
As I am a native speaker of telugu, I used to communicate more in telugu than english.
This is when I realized why I was unable to speak or understand in the USA.
Then I started improving my language skills because I was not able to have a fun time or enjoy my experience in the USA.
