01-26-2020 is a republic day for all Indians. But for me, it’s a day of reunion with my love and beginning of my life in the USA. “USA”, these 3 letters never enticed me to visit despite being the land of freedom and vibrance. But 5 letters of my love made me go. “Satya”, he is my friend, my love, my partner, my confidant. He is a part of my soul, he made me believe in love. For the first time in my life, I stepped onto a plane to experience a new world with: “Just a bag of accessories and clothes, but a whole lot of desire and hope.”{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I kept on checking my watch waiting for the moment to reach my destination. I wish I could be a marvel hero so I could have reached my destination earlier than this slow-moving flight. Finally, I reached the land of free after a long 24 journey. This is when my troubles began as a non native speaker. Little did I know I will be struggling a lot to communicate with the people here.{: style="text-align: justify;"}
