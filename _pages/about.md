My name is Dr.Anitha Karri. I graduated from Lenora Institute of Dental Sciences with a degree in Dental Surgery (BDS). I recently moved to the United States to live with my spouse.

Currently, I am trying to learn the culture, the language and the people here. I started this blog to document some of my experiences in the USA.
